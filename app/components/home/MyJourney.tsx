          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            My career journey began in customer service, tech support, and
            various non-profit organizations. Although these roles were
            valuable, I was eager to find a path that would truly ignite my
            passion and offer more engaging skills. This pursuit led me to web
            development through one of these non-profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Captivated by the potential for creativity and constant learning, I
            completed Web Development Bootcamp at Juno College of Technology in
            2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have professional experience as a web developer, building and
            maintaining dynamic, user-friendly websites. Iâ€™m now excited to
            bring my skills and passion to new opportunities, eager to
            contribute to innovative projects and grow further in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that by prioritizing accessibility in our work as web
            developers we make our contributions to the online world more
            meaningful.
