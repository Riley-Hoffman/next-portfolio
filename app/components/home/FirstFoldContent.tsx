      I am a web developer with a passion for building accessible, responsive,
      and user-focused web applications. Continuously driven by curiosity, I
      love adding new technologies to my skill set and quickly adapt to tech
      stack changes. As a proactive problem solver, I write optimized, modular,
      and reusable code that promotes seamless collaboration and elevates team
      productivity.
