        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My career journey began in customer service, tech support, and various
          non-profit organizations. Although these roles were valuable, I was
          eager to find a path that would truly ignite my passion and offer more
          engaging skills. This pursuit led me to web development through one of
          these non-profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Captivated by the potential for creativity and constant learning, I
          completed Web Development Bootcamp at Juno College of Technology in
          2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have professional experience as a web developer, building and
          maintaining dynamic, user-friendly websites. Iâ€™m now excited to bring
          my skills and passion to new opportunities, eager to contribute to
          innovative projects and grow further in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that by prioritizing accessibility in our work as web
          developers we make our contributions to the online world more
          meaningful.
